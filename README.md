## Instructions for Execution

The runnable jar files have been proved to ease the execution of the program. These files can be found 
in the "Runnable jar files" folder in the root directory. It contains two files - one for watcher and the 
other for player.

To execute the file, run the following command in the command line interface:  
	java -cp myplayer.jar Player player <.serverIp.> <.player name.>  
	java -cp mywatcher.jar MyWatcher watcher <.serverIp.> <.N.>  
	
Change the values of <...> these to your desired and valid values.
